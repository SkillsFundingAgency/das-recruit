                    @Model.LegalEntityName does not have an accepted agreement with the
                    Department for Education (DfE). Without an accepted agreement,
                    you can create a draft advert, but cannot post it on Find an apprenticeship.

                <p>
                    Only someone with the authority for your organisation can accept the agreement.
